         * Adapter design pattern
         * It allows two objects of different shapes (format or structure) to work together through a common interface
         * Letâ€™s say you have to build a charts library and it accepts data in a structured JSON object to render beautiful charts.
         *  You have one legacy API that returns the response in XML format.
         * We have to use this response and generate charts, but the charts library accepts a JSON object.
         *  We will write a function to convert this XML to JSON as required.
